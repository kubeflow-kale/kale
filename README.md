KALE (Kubeflow Automated pipeLines Engine) is a project that aims at simplifying
the Data Science experience of deploying Kubeflow Pipelines workflows.

Kubeflow is a great platform for orchestrating complex workflows on top
Kubernetes and Kubeflow Pipeline provides the mean to create reusable components
that can be executed as part of workflows. The self-service nature of Kubeflow
make it extremely appealing for Data Science use, at it provides an easy access
to advanced distributed jobs orchestration, re-usability of components, Jupyter
Notebooks, rich UIs and more. Still, developing and maintaining Kubeflow
workflows can be hard for data scientists, who may not be experts in working
orchestration platforms and related SDKs. Additionally, data science often
involve processes of data exploration, iterative modelling and interactive
environments (mostly Jupyter notebook).

Kale bridges this gap by providing a simple UI to define Kubeflow Pipelines
workflows directly from you JupyterLab interface, without the need to change a
single line of code.

Read more about Kale and how it works in this Medium post:
[Automating Jupyter Notebook Deployments to Kubeflow Pipelines with Kale](https://medium.com/kubeflow/automating-jupyter-notebook-deployments-to-kubeflow-pipelines-with-kale-a4ede38bea1f)

## Getting started

Install the Kale backend from PyPI and the JupyterLab extension. You can find a
set of curated Notebooks in the
[examples repository](https://github.com/kubeflow-kale/examples)

```bash
# install kale
pip install kubeflow-kale

# install jupyter lab
pip install "jupyterlab<2.0.0"

# install the extension
jupyter labextension install kubeflow-kale-launcher
# verify extension status
jupyter labextension list

# run
jupyter lab
```

To build images to be used as a NotebookServer in Kubeflow, refer to the
Dockerfile in the `docker` folder.

## Contribute

This repository uses
[husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)
to set up git hooks.

For `husky` to function properly, you need to have `yarn` installed and in your
`PATH`. The reason that is required is that `husky` is installed via
`jlpm install` and `jlpm` is a `yarn` wrapper. (Similarly, if it was installed
using the `npm` package manager, then `npm` would have to be in `PATH`.)

Currently installed git hooks:

- `pre-commit`: Run a prettier check on staged files, using
