## Taxi Cab Classification

This notebook presents a simplified version of Kubeflow's _taxi cab
classification_ pipeline, built upon TFX components.

Here all the pipeline components are stripped down to their core to showcase
how to run it in a self-contained local Jupyter Notebook.

Additionally, the pipeline has been upgraded to work with Python3 and all major
libraries (TensorFlow, TensorFlow Transform, TensorFlow Model Analysis,
TensorFlow Data Validation, Apache Beam) have been bumped to their latest
versions.
