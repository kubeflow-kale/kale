# Prototype of a model class  for an ML framework.
# Most of the member functions of the class will use two types of inputs:
#      - raw_data := a tuple of numpy arrays
#      - settings := a dictionary providing information to run the function.
#                   This dictionary will be initialized from the 'settings'
#                   section of the input json contract. Hence, all the
#                   information necessary to use all the member functions of
#                   the model should be already present in the 'settings'
#                   section of the json contract or at the latest added during
#                   the preprocessing operation.
