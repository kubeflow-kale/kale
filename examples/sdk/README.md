## Run Kubeflow Pipelines with the Kale SDK

This folder is a collection of examples to get started with the Kale SDK.

- `skeleton.py`: a bare bone example that goes through the basics of the Kale
  SDK and its APIs
- `compression-pipeline.py`: a more advanced example that shows you how to run
  any CLI/non-Python tool from a Kale pipeline
- `retry-pipeline.py`: in this example you will learn to define retry
  strategies in case a pipeline step fails.
- `titanic/`: this folder contains Kale's Notebook Titanic pipeline, converted
  to use the SDK instead.
- `quantile-regression/`: this folder contains an adaptation of the original
  Shell's quantile regression pipeline.
