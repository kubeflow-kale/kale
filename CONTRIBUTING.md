# Contributing to Kale

This guide explains how to set up a development environment for Kale and contribute
to the project.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12+**
- **uv** - Installed automatically by `make`, or manually: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- **Node.js 18+** and **jlpm** (for frontend development only - jlpm comes with JupyterLab)
- **Kubernetes cluster** (optional, for KFP testing only) - [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/) or [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)

## Quick Start

```bash
make dev          # Run once to set up (installs Python + Node dependencies, builds extension)
make test         # Run tests
make jupyter      # Start JupyterLab
```

**Note:** You only need to run `make dev` once. After the initial setup, just use `make test`, `make jupyter`, etc. Run `make dev` again only if:
- You pulled changes that modified `pyproject.toml` or `package.json`
- You ran `make clean`
- Dependencies need to be reinstalled

Run `make help` to see all available commands.

## Managing Dependencies

### Adding a Python Dependency

1. Edit the appropriate `pyproject.toml`:
   - Backend dependencies: `backend/pyproject.toml` in `[project.dependencies]`
   - Dev dependencies: `backend/pyproject.toml` in `[project.optional-dependencies.dev]`
   - Labextension dependencies: `labextension/pyproject.toml` in `[project.dependencies]`

2. Update the lockfile:
   ```bash
   make lock
   ```

3. Sync your environment:
   ```bash
   uv sync --all-packages --all-extras
   ```

### Adding a JavaScript Dependency

```bash
cd labextension
uv run jlpm add <package-name>      # Production dependency
uv run jlpm add -D <package-name>   # Dev dependency
```

### Upgrading All Dependencies

```bash
make lock-upgrade
```

## Building Release Artifacts

Build the production wheels for testing or distribution:

```bash
make build-backend       # Creates: dist/kubeflow_kale-2.0.0a1-py3-none-any.whl
make build-labextension  # Creates: dist/kubeflow_kale_labextension-2.0.0a1-py3-none-any.whl
```

### Testing in a Fresh Environment

To test the wheels work correctly in isolation:

```bash
# Create a fresh virtual environment
mkdir /tmp/kale-test && cd /tmp/kale-test
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate

# Install JupyterLab and both Kale wheels
uv pip install "jupyterlab>=4.0.0,<5" \
  /path/to/kale/dist/kubeflow_kale-2.0.0a1-py3-none-any.whl \
  /path/to/kale/dist/kubeflow_kale_labextension-2.0.0a1-py3-none-any.whl

# Start JupyterLab
jupyter lab
```

**Note:** The labextension depends on the backend (`kubeflow-kale>=2.0.0a1`). Once both packages are published to PyPI, users will only need to install `kubeflow-kale-labextension` and the backend will be pulled automatically.

## Testing with KFP Clusters

When testing compiled pipelines on a KFP cluster (e.g., Kind or Docker Desktop),
you need to serve your local wheel so the cluster can install it.

### Docker Host Configuration

For KFP pods to reach your local wheel server, they need to resolve `host.docker.internal`:

| Platform | Configuration |
|----------|---------------|
| **macOS (Docker)** | Works automatically |
| **Windows (Docker)** | Works automatically |
| **Linux (Docker)** | Add `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway` to `docker run` |
| **Kind on macOS/Windows** | Works automatically (uses Docker Desktop) |
| **Kind on Linux** | Configure Kind to use host network or extra port mappings |

**Linux Docker example:**
```bash
docker run --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway ...
```

**Kind on Linux** - add to your Kind cluster config:
```yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
  - role: control-plane
    extraPortMappings:
      - containerPort: 8765
        hostPort: 8765
```

**Podman (experimental)** - `host.docker.internal` is not natively supported:
```bash
# Option 1: Add host manually
podman run --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway ...

# Option 2: Use host network
podman run --network=host ...
```

### How serve-wheel Works

The `make kfp-serve` command:

1. Builds the backend wheel with a fixed version (`2.0.0a1` by default)
2. Copies the wheel to `.kfp-wheels/` directory
3. Starts a simple HTTP server on port 8765
4. Kind/Docker clusters can reach this server via `host.docker.internal:8765`

The fixed version ensures reproducibility - you can rebuild the wheel multiple
times and it will always have the same version, so compiled pipelines continue
to work. Override the version with `make kfp-build KFP_DEV_VERSION=x.y.z`.

When you set `KALE_PIP_INDEX_URLS`, Kale's compiler includes this URL in the
generated KFP DSL. The pipeline components then install Kale from your local
server instead of PyPI.

### Environment Variables

When using HTTP URLs for package indexes, pip requires them to be marked as trusted:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `KALE_PIP_INDEX_URLS` | Comma-separated list of pip index URLs |
| `KALE_PIP_TRUSTED_HOSTS` | Comma-separated list of trusted hosts (required for HTTP) |

### CLI Workflow

```bash
# Terminal 1: Serve the wheel
make kfp-serve

# Terminal 2: Compile (env vars are set automatically)
make kfp-compile NB=examples/base/candies_sharing.ipynb

# The generated pipeline is at .kale/<notebook-name>.kale.py
# Upload it to KFP UI or use kfp-run to submit directly
```

### Extension Workflow (JupyterLab UI)

To use the Kale extension with your local wheel:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Serve the wheel
make kfp-serve

# Terminal 2: Start JupyterLab with KFP env vars
make jupyter-kfp
```

The `jupyter-kfp` target sets the required environment variables automatically.
When you click "Compile and Run" in the Kale panel, the generated pipeline
will include your local wheel URL and trusted host configuration.

> NOTE:
>
> If you are not using `kind` or on Linux you must set `KFP_HOST_ADDR` before running `make jupyter-kfp`.
>
> For example, `minikube` users should use `KFP_HOST_ADDR=host.minikube.internal`
>
> To let KFP access localhost you may also need to disable the firewall:
> `sudo systemctl stop firewalld`

### With KFP Host (Direct Submission)

If you have a KFP instance running and want to submit directly:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Serve the wheel
make kfp-serve

# Terminal 2: Compile and submit (env vars are set automatically)
make kfp-run NB=examples/base/candies_sharing.ipynb KFP_HOST=http://localhost:8080
```

## Versioning

- **Backend**: Uses `setuptools_scm` - version derived from git tags automatically
- **Labextension**: Version set in `labextension/package.json`

During development, commits after a tag get version like `1.0.0.dev31+gHASH`.

## Live Reload

| Component | Live Reload? | Method |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| Labextension | Yes | `make watch-labextension` + browser refresh (F5) |
| Backend | No | Restart Jupyter kernel (`0 0` in command mode) |

**Browser refresh vs Kernel restart:**
- **Browser refresh (F5)**: Reloads JupyterLab UI to pick up labextension (TypeScript/JS) changes
- **Kernel restart (`0 0`)**: Restarts the Python process to pick up backend (Python) changes. Press `0` twice in command mode, or use Kernel menu → "Restart Kernel"

Note: Python's import caching (`sys.modules`) means backend changes require a
kernel restart. However, `make test-backend` always runs with fresh imports.

## Testing

Backend tests compare generated DSL against golden files in `backend/kale/tests/assets/kfp_dsl/`.
When modifying template output, update these fixtures.

```bash
make test-backend-unit   # Quick unit tests
make test-backend        # All backend tests
make test-labextension   # Labextension tests
make test                # Everything
```

## Pre-commit Hooks

Install pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Hooks include:
- `uv-lock`: Ensures `uv.lock` is up to date
- `trailing-whitespace`: Removes trailing whitespace
- `end-of-file-fixer`: Ensures files end with newline
- `ruff`: Python linting and formatting

## Debugging

### VS Code

Open the project in VS Code - debug configurations are provided in `.vscode/launch.json`:
- Debug Current Test File
- Debug All Unit Tests
- Debug Kale CLI
- Debug JupyterLab


## Development Checklist

1. Set up your environment: `make dev`
2. Make your changes
3. Run tests: `make test`
4. Run linting: `make lint`
5. Update fixtures if template output changed
6. Commit your changes

Happy hacking! If anything in this guide is unclear, open an issue or PR with improvements.
