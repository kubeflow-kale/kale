# Contributing

This page is the shorter, docs-site-friendly version of
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/kubeflow/kale/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
in the repository. If you're about to open a PR, start here and then read
the full document for release-engineering details.

## Before you start

If you haven't already, skim [Architecture](architecture/index.md) — it's a quick tour
of the codebase and saves a lot of time when you need to find the right
file to change.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** (3.12 is recommended).
- **uv** — installed automatically by `make dev`, or manually:
  ```bash
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  ```
- **Node.js 22+** and `jlpm` — only required if you're touching the
  labextension. `jlpm` ships with JupyterLab.
- **A Kubernetes cluster** (optional) — only needed when testing
  generated pipelines end-to-end.

## Set up your environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kubeflow/kale.git
cd kale

make dev          # one-time setup
make test         # run backend + labextension tests
make jupyter      # open JupyterLab with the extension loaded
```

You only need to re-run `make dev` after pulling changes that touch
`pyproject.toml` / `package.json`, or after `make clean`.

## Make targets you'll use

| Target                 | Description                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `make dev`             | One-time environment setup.                      |
| `make test`            | Run all tests (backend + labextension).          |
| `make test-backend`    | Backend tests only.                              |
| `make test-backend-unit` | Fast unit tests only.                          |
| `make test-labextension` | Labextension tests only.                       |
| `make lint`            | Run all linters.                                 |
| `make lint-backend`    | Ruff check on the Python package.                |
| `make lint-labextension` | ESLint + Prettier on the TypeScript source.    |
| `make format-backend`  | Auto-fix Ruff findings.                          |
| `make build`           | Build a wheel.                                   |
| `make docs`            | Build the docs site (this website).              |
| `make docs-serve`      | Build and serve docs locally on port 8000.       |

Run `make help` in the repository root for the full list.

## Managing Python dependencies

Edit `pyproject.toml` under the right section:

- Runtime dependencies: `[project.dependencies]`
- JupyterLab runtime: `[project.optional-dependencies.jupyter]`
- Dev tools: `[project.optional-dependencies.dev]`
- Documentation: `[project.optional-dependencies.docs]`

Then update the lockfile with `make lock` and sync the environment with
`uv sync --all-extras`.

## Pre-commit hooks

Install pre-commit hooks with:

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

Installed hooks:

- `uv-lock` — ensure `uv.lock` is in sync.
- `trailing-whitespace`, `end-of-file-fixer` — standard hygiene.
- `ruff` — Python linting and formatting.

## Contributing to the docs

This docs site lives under `docs/source/` and is built with Sphinx + Furo
+ MyST Parser. To add or edit a page:

1. Drop a new `.md` or `.rst` file into the appropriate directory under
   `docs/source/`.
2. Reference it from the toctree in `docs/source/index.md` so it appears
   in the sidebar.
3. Run `make docs` to build the site locally.
4. Run `make docs-serve` to view it at <http://localhost:8000>.

API reference pages use Sphinx autodoc via `.. automodule::`. If you're
adding or modifying public Python API, make sure you use Google-style
docstrings (Napoleon is enabled) and add/update the corresponding page in
`docs/source/api/`.

## Development checklist

Before opening a pull request:

1. `make test` — all tests pass.
2. `make lint` — no linter findings.
3. If you changed the generated KFP DSL, update the golden fixtures under
   `kale/tests/assets/kfp_dsl/`.
4. If you changed public Python API, update the `docs/source/api/` pages.
5. If you added or changed a user-visible feature, update the relevant
   pages under `docs/source/user-guide/` or `docs/source/concepts/`.
6. Write a clear commit message describing the change and the motivation.

## Releasing

Release procedures are documented in
[RELEASE.md](https://github.com/kubeflow/kale/blob/main/RELEASE.md). If you
don't have publish rights, you don't need to worry about this file.
