  <p class="tagline">From Jupyter Notebook to Kubeflow Pipeline — Zero Boilerplate</p>
</div>
```

**Kale** (Kubeflow Automated pipeLines Engine) turns annotated Jupyter notebooks
into production-ready [Kubeflow Pipelines](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/)
without requiring you to write a single line of KFP SDK code.

Tag cells in your notebook, let Kale figure out the data dependencies between
them, and compile the whole thing into a KFP v2 pipeline you can run on any
Kubeflow cluster.


## Why Kale?

::::{grid} 1 2 2 2
:gutter: 3

:::{grid-item-card} No SDK boilerplate
Annotate cells, compile, run. Kale generates the KFP v2 DSL for you — no need
to learn components, artifacts, or Python decorators.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} Automatic data passing
Variables flow between steps as if you were still in a single notebook. Kale's
type-aware marshalling handles numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, Keras,
TensorFlow, XGBoost and more.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} JupyterLab integration
Tag cells visually, define step dependencies, and submit pipelines from the
Kale side panel inside JupyterLab 4.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} KFP v2 native
Compiles to the modern KFP v2 pipeline DSL with full artifact support. Runs on
any compliant Kubeflow Pipelines backend.

## Kale in the Kubeflow ecosystem

Kale is part of the Kubeflow **ML Experience Working Group**, alongside the
[Kubeflow SDK](https://sdk.kubeflow.org/), [Kubeflow Pipelines](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/)
and [Kubeflow Notebooks](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/notebooks/).
It lives at the notebook layer — where data scientists prototype — and bridges
the gap to the pipeline layer, where production workloads run.

If KFP is the "how" of running ML pipelines on Kubernetes, Kale is the "what
you meant": take the notebook you already have, and turn it into a pipeline
without rewriting anything.
